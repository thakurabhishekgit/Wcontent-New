    fullArticle: `
This trend leverages short attention spans by delivering a focused narrative. Instead of a sprawling "day in the life," creators isolate a single compelling moment, skill, or experience. It works great on TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts because it's easily digestible and has a clear point.

- **High Completion Rate:** Viewers are more likely to watch a 30-second video to its end.
- **Relatability:** Focusing on a single, often simple, task feels authentic and achievable.
- **Consistency:** The simple format makes it easier for creators to post daily, building a loyal following.

**Key elements:**
- A clear, concise voiceover.
- Fast, dynamic cuts.

**Key elements:**
- Start by clearly showing the problem or frustration.
- Build anticipation for the unboxing moment.
